    <summary>Why?</summary>

    The first reason - consuming of PC resources. Meridius consumes PC resources less than any desktop browser.

    <summary>Why VK if Spotify / Apple Music more easy and has more music?</summary>

    Yes, it has, many other services has more information about songs, artists and playlists, but from personal experience I could say that this services has no so much music cause VK users can upload any music in any time.

    <summary>How to login?</summary>

    The application does not provide the possibility of authorization using password-free methods. To log in, you need to set a password for your account. This can be done by installing two-factor authentication and the VK will ask you to set a password.

    <summary>How to download music?</summary>

    Open download settings, then install FFmpeg and turn on music downloading. On Linux (not FlatHub) you must to have install FFmpeg yourself.

<details>
    <summary>Can you upload source code?</summary>

    Source code will be upload if I tired of developing. In the meantime, I have the right not to do it.

<details>
    <summary>Very low FPS</summary>

    This problem occurs on monitors with G-Sync support. Disable hardware acceleration in the settings and restart the app.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Stucks on the logo. Can't load!</summary>

    This happens if the signal does not reach VK. In this case, check which country you live in, and make sure that you have a VPN enabled in the system (that is, not an extension in the browser). Next, if you do not have VK blocked in your country, make sure that you have the original Windows installed, and not the Windows build, where everything unnecessary is supposedly disabled.

    <summary>Does not run on my Linux distribution</summary>

    Before the release, the application is tested on Fedora and Ubuntu, and if the application runs stably on these systems, then look for a problem in your system - the low-level problems of each OS are not supported.
